# Surfs Up
## Overview
Using SQLite and SQL Alchemy, an analysis of Oahu, Hawaii weather was conducted to determine the average temperature during the months of June and December.  The purpose of this analysis was to evaluate whether opening a surf and ice cream shop would be a sound business decision.
### Results
* The average temperature in June was 74.9, compared to 71.0 in December.
* The minimum temperature in June was 64, compared to 56 in December.
* The maximum temperature in June was 85, compared to 83 in December.

### Summary
#### Overview
Overall, the temperature is similar during June and December, with an average temperature of only about four degrees less in December than in June.  The largest difference was the minimum temperature with December's minimum temperature being eight degrees less than June's minimum temperature.  
#### Two Additional Queries
One additional query that I would recommend performing to obtain a clearer picture of the weather would be to look at the precipitation rates during these months.  This would allow us to see how many days were surfing appropriate weather.  Another query that I would recommend would be to determine the hours of sunlight each day during these months.  This would allow us to determine if there is enough surfing time for a surf shop to be a viable business decision.
